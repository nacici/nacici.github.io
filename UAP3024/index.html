               More than one half of the world population lives now in urban areas, and virtually all countries of the world are becoming increasingly urbanized. Smart urbanization process requires information, such as population growth, changes in demographic compositions, economic activities and demand of infastructures to allcoate human and monetary resources efficiently. Such information are analzed via applying well-designed demographic, economic, land use, and tranpsortation models to various urban datasets. This class offers an introduction to quantitative analysis for planners, with a focus on data and analytics skills typically used in planning analysis. By the end of the semester, students should be familiar with various planning data sources and foundational stastical concepts, and visualization/presentation skills.

               The goals of this course are:
               <ol>

                  <li>Knowledge of existing data sources for planning analysis</li>
                  <li>Basic tools for demographic/cohort analysis</li>
                  <li>Foundamental economic metrics </li>
                  <li>Understanding of statistical models and interpreting results and apply models to planning problems</li>
                  <li>Land use and transportation demand analysis</li>
                  <li>Ability to present and visualize the results</li>
                  <li>Familiar with quantiative analysis in Excel</li>


               </ol>
               
               In general, this course will serve as <b>a basic introduction for those who want to use quantiative model to perform population and economic analysis, as well as forecast demand for residential and commerical land uses and transportaiton infrastructures</b>. Students will be provided with a firm grounding in the principles and concepts of popualtion and economic analysis models, applications of these techniques to Census data to inform real-world planning process. By the end of the course, students are expected to understand the basic components of quantitative analysis in planning and to be familiar with the strength and limitations of different models.

               <h3 >Course Procedure and Organization</h3>
               The course is organized in a series of lectures, hands-on Excel exercises, and readings. The lectures and readings are designed to allow students to have basic knowledge of urban data structures, model principles, and implementations. The exercise session will provide students with hands-on experience using Excel. During the model implementation process, students will learn the skills to conduct data query, basic joining, and perform statistics tests in Excel. Students will use <span class="label label-warning">Google Classroom</span> to submit assignments. The class discussion with other participants and lecturer will be hosted on <span class="label label-warning">Piazza</span>. The class materials and schedules are published on the Google Classroom website.<br> <br>

               The challenge in learning quantitative analysis lies in absorbing a conceptual understanding of different urban modesl and linking this understanding with Excel training in implementation. Therefore, every attempt has been made wherever possible, to provide a “hands-on” exercise application of the concepts demonstrated in the previous lecture sessions. Additionally, practical case-studies in homework assignment will provide examples of the data and models learned in class may be applied in real-world practices, in data preparation, and in problem-solving, to bridge the gap between academics and technicalities.

                  <ul>
                     <li>HW1 [10%]: Statistic Analysis Using Census Data</li>

                     <li>HW4 [10%]: Land Use Demand Estimation</li>
                  </ul>

                  The detailed grading criteria will be provided in assignment descriptions. Students will have approxiatmely 1.5 - 2 weeks to finish the assignment. The in-class exercise sessions will cover similar questions!

                  There will be one team project for group of 3-4. Students are expected to utilize models learned in class to perform demographic and economic analysis to estiamte land use and transportation demands for an assigned study area. Scores will be distributed based on peer evaluation.
