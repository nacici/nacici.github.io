               The disruptive transportation technologies, especially the shared mobility and automated vehicles, are going to fundamentally change the way residents move around cities. Planners should act proactively to harvest the benefits of these new technologies, such as reducing accidents, providing affordable and reliable mobility service for the current underserved communities and mobility impaired population, and curbing transportation energy footprint via reducing vehicle ownership and improving the utilization rates of vehicles. Meanwhile, planners should also be fully aware of the negative externalities brought by the new technologies, including but not limited to more congestions, urban sprawl due to the reduction in travel costs, and accessibility problems due to digital divides. In this class, students will work with clients to examine the opportunities and challenges brought about by shared mobility and automated vehicles. The students will also be encouraged to think proactively to prepare cities for the coming of shared automated vehicles. By the end of the semester, students should be familiar with how these technologies are likely to impact different aspects of planning process, including transportation, real estate, land use, and urban design and prepare a survey that will be distributed to Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) and State Department of Transportation (DOTs) to understand how regional planning agencies are working towards the coming of these new technologies.

                  <li>Apply project and task management techniques in individual and collaborative work contexts</li>
                  <li>Apply norms and practices of professionals in planning-related fields</li>

               <h3 >Course Procedure and Organization</h3>
               <div class="alert alert-info">In the course, students will work on a <span class="label label-danger">REAL-WORLD PROJECT</span>: Examining the impact of shared automated vehicles on transportation, land use, urban design, and real estate planning. Students are expected to get familiar with the project and conduct literature review and summarize how shared automated vehicles will cause changes to cities, form driving forces, impacts, and implications perspectives. Built upon the literature review, students will also draft survey to collect information regarding how MPOs and State DOTs are preparing for the coming of these technologies. </div>

               The course is organized in a series of student lead seminars and/or invited guest speakers. The seminars and readings are designed to allow students to have fundamental knowledge about how Shared AVs will influence different aspects of the urban planning process. The weekly discussion topics can be found in the tentative schedule table below. <br>
               <br>
               Students will work collaboratively to summarize the reading materials by signing up the reading material google sheet. For each of the reading, the students should analyze (1) the driving forces of potential changes (i.e., why Shared and Automated Vehicles will cause changes), (2) potential secondary impacts (i.e., what are the envisioned changes), (3) implications to health, environment, equity, governance, and economy, and (4) proactive planners (i.e., what planners can do proactively and what are planners doing now?) <br>
               <br>
               The student who signed up to lead the weekly discussion will (1) summarize all the results in powerpoint (<a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rCZ1Tp7E1qG7B_fBrSgRAMd4BpqL9I8z/view?usp=sharing">here is the template</a>) for group discussion in class and (2) write up the section report (<a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rDFAbUDex_lzmlCOIi-XtrDIpz-4Wyx9/view?usp=sharing">here is the template</a>).<br>
