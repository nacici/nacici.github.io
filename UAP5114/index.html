               We are in the era of big data, with 2.5 exabytes - that's 2.5 billion gigabytes (GB) - of data generated every day. Planners are expected to be equipped with quantitative analysis skill sets and data visualization techniques to take advantage of urban big data to address/monitor/measure complex urban problems. This class offers an introduction to urban analytics to planners, with a focus on unstructured urban data acquisition and processing. Additionally, the class also provides fundamentals regarding machine learning and text mining algorithms that can be used to develop supervised and unsupervised predictive models to address real-world inquiries. The course also emphasizes on data visualization and communication skillsets to enhance planners public engagement skills in the age of big data. By the end of the semester, students should be familiar with adapting python scripts to obtain and process unstructured urban data, train and test machine learning models, and effectively visualize model outputs and communicate to local stakeholders.

               The objective of this course is to familiarize students with modern unstructured data acquisition, processing and machine learning techniques. The course also demonstrates how these tools can be applied in real-world context. The course is practice oriented, i.e., concepts and models are motivated and illustrated by application to urban problems and datasets. By the end of the semester, the students will be able to:

                <div class="alert alert-info">In the course, students will work on a <span class="label label-danger">REAL-WORLD PROJECT</span>: Evaluating the social and economic imapcts of Arlington Restaurant Initiative (ARI). Studnets are expected to get familiar with the project and develope social and economic evaluation framework based on the literature review for the first 2-3 weeks in the class.</div> 

               The course is organized in a series of lectures, hands-on exercises, and readings. The lectures and readings are designed to allow students to have basic knowledge of unstructure urban data, statistics analysis, machine learning, and implementations. The exercise session will provide students with hands-on experience adjusting Python Scripts for data acquisition, processing, model development, and model results analysis. During the implementation process, students will learn the skills to downloand data via APIs, scrape webiste, conduct data query, basic joining, perform statistics tests, as well as model development and evaluation in Python. Students will use <span class="label label-warning">Google Classroom</span> to submit assignments and discuss questions on class materials and homework. The class materials and schedules are published on the Google Classroom website.<br> 
               <br>
               The challenge in learning planning analytics lies in absorbing a conceptual understanding of different data acquisition and processing techniques with Python training in implementation. Therefore, every attempt has been made wherever possible, to provide a “hands-on” exercise application of the concepts demonstrated in the previous lecture sessions. Additionally, case-studies (i.e., ARI project for this semester) in homework assignment will provide examples of the data and models learned in class may be applied in real-world practices, in data preparation, and in problem-solving, to bridge the gap between academics and technicalities.

                  The detailed grading criteria will be provided in assignment descriptions. Students will have approxiatmely 1.5 - 2 weeks to finish the assignment. The in-class exercise sessions will demonstrate how to use/adjust Python Scripts to finish the assignment!

                  The objective of the final project is to develope a data dashboard for the Arlington County Police Department (ACPD) to check the long-term economcial and social impact of the Arlington Restaurant Initiative (ARI). The final project is an extensition of the HW 1 AND 2. The teams are expected to use the second half of the semester to improve and extend the impact evaluation framework and data from HW 1 and 2 and develop a comprehensive and professional data dashboard to be presented to ACPD.
